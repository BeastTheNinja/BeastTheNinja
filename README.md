## üîÑ Ongoing Project: SgtPrepper Full Stack Learning

I‚Äôm currently working on a full stack project with my teacher, learning how to use Node.js with a custom API and integrating databases using MySQL. This project is split into two parts:

- **Frontend:**  
  [SgtPrepper-frontend-code-along-with-teacher](https://github.com/BeastTheNinja/SgtPrepper-frontend-code-along-with-teacher)  
  Building user interfaces and connecting to the backend API, focusing on dynamic data and modern JavaScript/HTML practices.  
  *Languages:* JavaScript (90%), HTML (10%)

- **Backend/API:**  
  [prepper-api-ts-prisma](https://github.com/BeastTheNinja/prepper-api-ts-prisma)  
  Developing a backend API with TypeScript and Prisma for efficient data management and fast development workflows.  
  *Language:* TypeScript (100%)

This is an ongoing learning journey, and I‚Äôm continuously updating and improving both sides as I learn new technologies and best practices.
